## OVER VIEW OF PROJECT :
### PROJECT :Traffic light controller WITH VERILOG
- ### Objective:
 Finite State Machine (FSM) design is a key concept in digital logic and hardware design, used to model systems with a finite number of states.
 FSMs are widely used in various applications, from simple controllers to complex digital systems. Here's an overview of FSM design, including its concepts, types, design process, and examples using Verilog.
- ## 1. Concepts and Definitions
- State: A distinct condition or mode of the FSM, representing a particular status of the system.
- Transition: The movement from one state to another based on input conditions.
- State Diagram: A graphical representation of states, transitions, and actions.
- State Table: A tabular representation showing states, inputs, outputs, and next states.
- Current State: The state the FSM is currently in.
- Next State: The state the FSM will transition to, based on inputs and current state.
- Output: The result or action produced by the FSM based on the current state and inputs.
- ## 2. Types of FSMs
- Moore Machine: The outputs depend only on the current state. State transitions are driven by inputs.
- Mealy Machine: The outputs depend on both the current state and the inputs. Transitions can occur based on inputs and current state.
- ## Technology used
- Simulation Tools: ModelSim
 ## output wave forms
